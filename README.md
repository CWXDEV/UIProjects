Repo to test and research making GUI's

# WPFApp
- Not a fan of how the UI is done with this, finding out how to do things can be quite hard.

# MAUIApp
- Not as bad as WPF, but still not liking this way of doing UI's.

# ElectronApp
- going to try Electron.NET as the lib for getting system information on JS so very slow in comparison to C#. 

# GoApp
